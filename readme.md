Crypto is a personal tool for encrypting and decrypting up to 3 files at a time.

It is a Bash script currently that will likely be made into a python project for effeciency. This started as a short script for me to just do basic decrytions with ROT cyphers
but has now turned into a project that will eventually be a full encrytpion and decryption tool with more input from the user.

There are comments on the project that are notes as to things I want to do, but those will be removed and added to a different file in the near future.

Any collaboration efforts are welcome.

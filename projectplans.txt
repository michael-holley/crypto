These are future plans and features for this tool. Use this as a guide to manage the project board.

1. Probably rebuild this in Python for better efficiency and more robust features
	This may allow the ability to connect this to a library of decryption methods and allow more methods than BASH can
2. Build encryption feature framework
	Be able to encrypt in the most popular encryption methods
3. Create better decryption system that is more user friendly
	Don't just have it spit out a ton of messages to terminal.
	Maybe push decryptions in a series of files with decryption method in file name
	Maybe create a detection feature so that it only has to decrypt one time. This could be most effecient when there are many different methods added to src
4. Look for a more efficient way to write the ROT cyphers into the code. 
	Maybe there is an algorithm to write them all in one case.
5. Look into adding more complex cyphers like Vigenere
